# General Specifications

## Key features

<BlockImage src="hardware/specification/general/openarm-specs.png" alt="Openarm specs" width="110%" />

## General Dimensions

OpenArm has a small human-like physique. The support pillars are made of MiSUMi aluminum frames, making it easy to adjust the dimensions and attach cameras, sensors, and other attachments.
The base plate has evenly spaced M6 taps, allowing it to be fixed directly to a table or other surface.
Each joint has a mechanical limit that restricts the range of motion for safety.

##  Payload definition

### Nominal payload : 4.1kg

Nominal payload means the weight that could be held for one minute in the worst posture (arms extended to maximum).

### Peak payload : 6.0kg

Peak payload means the weight that could be moved from the arms down to the worst posture over a period of 3 seconds and held for 1 second before returning.

:::warning
Note that the payload contains the end effector.
For example, if a 1.5 kg end-effector is attached to the OpenArm, the nominal payload is 2.6 kg and the peak payload is 4.5 kg.
